Accomplishments:
With a structure of database set up, a few APIs are defined in DBO.java for connecting to the database server. Some of them are not implemented yet ans will be co-implemented with the calling functions.
Plan:
A model for user login, password salting, hashing, storage, etc. will be discussed within and implemented as backend servlets and frontend methods.
Will work on implementing a server logging system.
